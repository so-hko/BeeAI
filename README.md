# BeeAI
steel plate faults data analysis and preprocessing for deep learning using BeeAI framework

#Preprocessing 
is messy - it's included separating Train(80%)data and Test(20%)data of entire Faults data with Any shuffling and adding misssing values.

#Preprocessing2 
is included - 
Separating Train and Test of entire data and it's shuffled and added missing values,
+the Train and Test data was seperated UNIFORMLY - the proportions of the labled attributes(27 kinds)

***************************************************************************************************************

#Preprocessing3
FOR SUBMISSION of BeeAI Competition
1 Separated the entire Faults data into 80% and 20% so that the ratio of the labeled attributes is uniform.
2 Shuffled the datas(Each of both train(80%)data and test(20%)data) and added the missing values as well.
3 return to CSV file.
